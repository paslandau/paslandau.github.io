<h2><a id="setting-up-the-software"></a>Setting up the software</h2>
<h3><a id="git-and-git-bash"></a>Git and Git Bash</h3>
<p>First of all, we're going to install a decent terminal on windows, because we will have to do some stuff on the command line and once you're
working with vagrant you'll have to do this via SSH and it's just convenient to have a similar tool set available on Windows as on Unix (e.g. history search).</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the current Git version from the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git download page for Windows</a>. Download should start automatically
when you open the link.</li>
<li>Open the file to start the installation</li>
<li>When you hit the &quot;Select Components&quot; step, make sure the checkbox next to &quot;Git Bash here&quot; is checked. That option enables a new entry in the
context menu when right-clicking in a windows folder to open a Git Bash at this directory.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-select-components.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-select-components.PNG" alt="Git Bash select components" /></a></li>
<li>During the installation we'll have the convenient opportunity that the installation wizard adjusts our <code>PATH</code> variable automatically,
so that we can access the <code>git</code> commands globally. I prefer to go with the middle option &quot;Use Git from Windows Command Prompt&quot;.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-adjust-path.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-adjust-path.PNG" alt="Git Bash adjust PATH" /></a></li>
<li>When being asked for the preferred way to handle line endings, I would advise to go for the middle option again. &quot;Checkout as-is, commit
Unix-style line endings&quot;. Since we're using PhpStorm we don't need to have CRLF as line ending - just LF does fine and is cross-plattform
compatible. Just be advised that only LF line endings are not not shown as new lines when using the &quot;normal&quot; windows text editor.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-configure-line-endings.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-configure-line-endings.PNG" alt="Git Bash configure line endings" /></a></li>
<li>When being asked for the terminal emulator make sure to choose &quot;Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MYSY2)&quot;.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-terminal-emulator.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-terminal-emulator.PNG" alt="Git Bash terminal emulator" /></a></li>
<li>Confirm the remaining steps with &quot;Next&quot; and finish the installation</li>
<li>Open a new Git Bash shell and do the most basic setup step:
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>
<p><a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-initial-setup.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/git-bash/git-initial-setup.PNG" alt="Git initial setup" /></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, we now have a much prettier (and more powerful) shell to work with. I won't get any deeper into Git itself as
there are <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">much better introductions/tutorials on Git</a>
out there than I could possibly write :) </p>
<h3><a id="oracle-virtualbox"></a>Oracle VirtualBox</h3>
<p>VirtualBox is the software that runs the virtual machine that we can use to run our code on. Using a virtual machine
makes it possible to use the environment/infrastructure of a production system during local development and thus
minimizes the error potential when finally going to production. When you're just starting out, those benefits probably
aren't immediately clear to you, but once you begin to design whole systems with multiple components like databases,
caches, web servers etc., this approach becomes incredibly helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest version of VirtualBox from the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox download page</a>.
As of writing this tutorial, the current version is &quot;VirtualBox 5.0.20 for Windows hosts&quot;.</li>
<li>Run the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions. There's actually nothing to explain ;)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="vagrant"></a>Vagrant</h3>
<p>Technically, we wouldn't even need vagrant for our development as the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; is done by VirtualBox and once
we've got our virtual machine up and running, we can start running code on it. But getting the setup right is actually not an
easy task and requires manual involvement. We don't want that. We want a simple, reproducible, formalized way of defining
our virtual machine. Vagrant does exactly that: It gives us a simple configuration language that fulfills those requirements
and makes it even sharable with other team members to get them started quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download the 1.7.4 version of Vagrant from the <a href="https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/">Vagrant download archive page</a>
(the <a href="https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.msi">vagrant_1.7.4.msi file</a> is the installer for Windows)
As of writing this tutorial, the current version is 1.8.5 but that didn't work for me. (More concrete, I got the error</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The box 'laravel/homestead' could not be found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when trying to set up homestead.)</p>
</li>
<li>Run the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions. Again, nothing fancy here but you'll probably
need to restart your system after the installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vagrant will automatically be added to the <code>PATH</code> variable, so it can be called globally. To confirm that the
installation was successful, run &quot;vagrant -v&quot;, which should yield a similar output to this:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant -v
Vagrant 1.7.4</code></pre>
<h3><a id="homestead"></a>Homestead</h3>
<p>Homestead is a vagrant base box that is maintained by the creator of Laravel, Taylor Otwell. There's actually a chapter
on <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead">Homestead in the Laravel documentation</a> that does a pretty good job explaining
how to set homestead up, so I'll keep this section rather short.</p>
<p>Since we've already installed VirtualBox and Vagrant, all we need to do is running <code>vagrant box add laravel/homestead --box-version 0.4.4</code>.
That command will download <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/0.4.4">the homestead box version v0.4.4 from the vagrant catalogue</a>
to (by default) <code>~/.vagrant.d/boxes</code> or in Windows terms <code>C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\.vagrant.d\boxes</code>. You can change this location
by setting the <code>VAGRANT_HOME</code> path variable as explained <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10226134/413531">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> We specified the concrete version because a simple <code>vagrant box add laravel/homestead</code> would download the
<em>latest</em> version of homestead which is (at the time of this writing) v0.5.0 and contains the newest Ubuntu release 16.04.
If you want to go with that version, make sure to also download and install the <em>latest</em> vagrant version (currently 1.8.5).
It is possible ot have multiple versions of a vagrant box on your host machine, but it requires some additional
setup to choose the right box. Please refer to this <a href="http://laravel.io/forum/02-03-2016-install-specific-laravel-homestead-version-and-502-bad-gateway-nginx-solved?page=1#reply-29937">answer</a>
for further information.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You might encounter the following error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ vagrant box add laravel/homestead
==&gt; box: Loading metadata for box 'laravel/homestead'
box: URL: <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/homestead">https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/homestead</a>
Vagrant is attempting to interface with the UI in a way that requires
a TTY. Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration
switches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant
with TTY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explanation: The homestead box can work with either VMware or VirtualBox and Vagrant leaves this decision to you. The error
indicates that Vagrant doesn't understand which terminal (TTY) you are using and thus cannot display the options for you to
choose from.</p>
<p>Solution (as found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/32398981">here</a>): Define the new environment variable
<code>VAGRANT_DETECTED_OS=cygwin</code>. </p>
<p><a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/homestead/vagrant-detected-os-environment-variable.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/homestead/vagrant-detected-os-environment-variable.PNG" alt="VAGRANT_DETECTED_OS=cygwin" /></a></p>
<p>Open up a new shell and run <code>vagrant box add laravel/homestead</code> again. The output should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant box add laravel/homestead
==&gt; box: Loading metadata for box 'laravel/homestead'
    box: URL: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/homestead
This box can work with multiple providers! The providers that it
can work with are listed below. Please review the list and choose
the provider you will be working with.

1) virtualbox
2) vmware_desktop

Enter your choice: </code></pre>
<p>Type <code>1</code> and press <code>Enter</code>. This might take some time but should in the end look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your choice: 1
==&gt; box: Adding box 'laravel/homestead' (v0.4.4) for provider: virtualbox
    box: Downloading: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/0.4.4/providers/virtualbox.box
    box:
==&gt; box: Successfully added box 'laravel/homestead' (v0.4.4) for 'virtualbox'!</code></pre>
<p>Let's make sure everything works as expected by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new directory and <code>cd</code> into it
<pre><code>$ mkdir test &amp;&amp; cd test</code></pre></li>
<li>Run <code>vagrant init laravel/homestead</code> to create an initial <code>Vagrantfile</code> with our new homestead box as base in the <code>test</code> directory
<pre><code>$ vagrant init laravel/homestead
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Vagrantfile</code> holds the configuration options for the vagrant box, but we don't need to change anything in there for now
(unless you have a device on your network that is occupying the 192.169.10.10 IP address,
which is the default IP that vagrant will assign to the VM)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>vagrant up</code> to start the virtual machine</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant up

Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.

There's actually even a note in the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead#introduction">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you are using Windows, you may need to enable hardware virtualization (VT-x). It can usually be enabled via your BIOS. If you are using Hyper-V on a UEFI system you may additionally need to disable Hyper-V in order to access VT-x.</p>

which does a great job explaining exactly how to enable the hardware virtualization. <em>Note</em>: the most easy way for me to get to the BIOS
was simply to hit the WIN key and search for &quot;Advanced Startup&quot; and then clicking on the &quot;Restart now&quot; button. In the upcoming screens I chose
<code>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; UEFI Firmware Settings</code>. If you still have problems to get into the BIOS, read on <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/126016/three-ways-to-access-the-windows-8-boot-options-menu/">here</a></p>

within a virtual machine (yeah, talk about virtualiception ;)). Reason: I can't enable VT-x/AMD-x in the virtual machine. More in depth info on that problem

<p>Congratulations, you've successfully overcome every obstacle and are now the proud owner

<h2><a id="configuring-phpstorm-to-use-the-vagrant-box"></a>Configuring PhpStorm to use the vagrant box</h2>
<p>Setting up PhpStorm to work with your newly created vagrant box can be a little tricky, as the process is not really
that straight forward. But in the end it's just a matter of &quot;knowing where to click&quot; (and having a little bit of background
info on what's happening behind the scenes is also helpful ;)). And it will <em>not</em> work as expected, but I think it's still
helpful to explain why that is the case and how to work around it.</p>
<p>PS: There is also a <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Working+with+Advanced+Vagrant+features+in+PhpStorm">Working with Advanced Vagrant features in PhpStorm</a>
tutorial. Although their approach is a little different, so take it as a nice to know :)</p>
<ul>
<li>open up PhpStorm and open the settings via <code>File &gt; Settings...</code></li>
<li>enter the search box at the top left, type &quot;PHP&quot; and choose the entry named &quot;PHP&quot; under &quot;Laguages &amp; Frameworks&quot; from the resulting list
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/select-php-interpreter.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/select-php-interpreter.PNG" alt="Select a new PHP interpreter in PhpStorm" /></a></li>
<li>click on the &quot;...&quot; next to &quot;Interpreter&quot;. This opens the interpreter settings for PhpStorm</li>
<li>click on the green &quot;+&quot; on the top left and choose &quot;Remote...&quot; to add a new interpreter. Technically, vagrant is a
&quot;remote&quot; interpreter as we're going to access it via SSH over our local network. </li>
<li>in the pop up window choose &quot;Vagrant&quot; and select the directory that your &quot;Vagrantfile&quot; is in
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/add-vagrant-remote.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/add-vagrant-remote.PNG" alt="Add vagrant as remote interpreter" /></a>
After clicking &quot;OK&quot;, PhpStorm will perform some checks (e.g. connect via SSH to vagrant and look for PHP).</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;Interpreters&quot; window now contains a new entry with the newly generated vagrant remote interpreter.

By default, it should be named something like &quot;Remote PHP 7&quot; which I would recommend renaming to &quot;Vagrant PHP 7&quot;.
Also note the warning that says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>No path mapping were found. Please, configure them at Vagrantfile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we didn't touch the <code>Vagrantfile</code>, it's true that we didn't configure any path mapping. That means, we did not tell vagrant which folder of
our host machine should be made available to the virtual machine. Why do we need this? Well, we're going to execute the source code that we are editing
within PhpStorm in the <em>host</em> system in the virtual machine (the <em>remote</em> system), so we need to make it available to the <em>remote</em> system. </p>
</li>
<li>Open up your <code>Vagrantfile</code> in the <code>test</code> directory. There's a lot of stuff in there, but it is mostly commented out and just serves as a blueprint
if you need to change the defaults. You can actually delete all of it and replace it with the following content:
<pre><code>Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
config.vm.box = "laravel/homestead"
config.vm.synced_folder "C:\\Users\\Pascal\\PhpstormProjects\\untitled", "/vagrant_data"
end</code></pre>
<p>where <code>C:\\Users\\Pascal\\PhpstormProjects\\untitled</code> is the path to my PhpStorm project. You can easily get that path if you right-click
on the project folder within PhpStorm and select <code>Copy as path</code> from the context menu. Please make sure to use double <code>\\</code> instead of single <code>\</code> within the path!
This makes the project folder on your host machine available to the virtual machine at the directory <code>/vagrant_data</code></p></li>
<li>To enable the changes, we need to restart the vagrant box via <code>vagrant reload</code>. Run the command on your host machine in the directory that holds the
<code>Vagrantfile</code>. If you are still logged into the virtual machine, press CTRL + D to logout.
<pre><code>$ vagrant reload

==&gt; default: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
==&gt; default: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.</code></pre>
<p>Please note the line <code>default: /vagrant_data =&gt; C:/Users/Pascal/PhpstormProjects/untitled</code> which tells us that the path mapping is in place.
Also, take note of the lines</p>
<pre><code>==&gt; default: Forwarding ports...
    default: 22 =&gt; 2222 (adapter 1)
==&gt; default: Booting VM...
==&gt; default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222</code></pre>
<p>That basically means, that the port 22 on the virtual machine is tunneled to port 2222 on the host machine.
2222 is the vagrant default but we could override this setting in the Vagrantfile.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Ok, let's get back to the &quot;Interpreters&quot; window in PhpStorm. In case you closed it, just repeat the first steps of this section.
But: <strong>The warning still isn't gone!</strong> That is the part that always through me off in the beginning, because I would have expected PhpStorm
to figure the path mappings out automagically. But if we run <code>test.php</code> right now, we get the following result:</p>
<pre><code>vagrant://C:/Users/Pascal/Desktop/test/usr/bin/php C:\Users\Pascal\PhpstormProjects\untitled\test.php
bash: line 0: cd: C:/Users/Pascal/PhpstormProjects/untitled: No such file or directory
Could not open input file: C:UsersPascalPhpstormProjectsuntitledtest.php

Process finished with exit code 1</code></pre>
<p>PhpStorm has no idea where to look within the virtual machine. How can we still get this to work?</p>
</li>
<li>Well, here's how: Enter the search box at the top left, type &quot;Deployment&quot; and choose the entry named &quot;Deployment&quot; from the resulting list.
Now click on the green &quot;+&quot; at the top left, enter &quot;Vagrant&quot; as name and choose &quot;SFTP&quot; as type.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-deployment-settings.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-deployment-settings.PNG" alt="Add vagrant via sftp deployment" /></a>
Actually, the name doesn't matter, you can enter what ever you want there ;)</li>
<li>
<p>in the &quot;Connection&quot; tab, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>SFTP host: 127.0.0.1</li>
<li>Port: 2222</li>
<li>User name: vagrant</li>
<li>Auth type: Password</li>
<li>Password: vagrant</li>
<li>check the &quot;Save password&quot; checkbox</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-deployment-connection.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-deployment-connection.PNG" alt="Deployment connection settings for vagrant" /></a>
So what does that mean? Those settings tell PhpStorm to connect via SFTP to our vagrant box by using the port 2222 on our host machine -
which tunnels to port 22 on the virtual machine as mentioned above. To do so, it uses the username &quot;vagrant&quot; and the password &quot;vagrant&quot;
for authentication. Again, those credentials are the default values for vagrant (and will be used &quot;behind the scenes&quot; if you use <code>vagrant ssh</code>
to ssh into a vagrant machine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, open the &quot;Mappings&quot; tab and enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local path: [path to your local PhpStorm project - this should already be set]</li>
<li>Deployment path on server 'Vagrant': /vagrant_data </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-path-mappings.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/vagrant-path-mappings.PNG" alt="Path mappings for vagrant" /></a>
We're basically telling PhpStorm what we told vagrant via the Vagrantfile:
<code>C:/Users/Pascal/PhpstormProjects/untitled</code> (in my case) maps to <code>/vagrant_data</code></p>
</li>
<li>Confirm with &quot;OK&quot; and go back to the &quot;Interpreters&quot; window in PhpStorm. Repeat the first steps of this section to get there.
Choose the remote interpreter we added before but instead of the &quot;Vagrant&quot; radio button, check the &quot;Deployment configuration&quot; radio button.
Choose the &quot;Vagrant&quot; configuration we just created and hit &quot;Apply&quot;. There should be no warnings left.
<a href="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/interpreter-vagrant-via-deployment.PNG"><img src="/img/phpstorm-with-vagrant-using-laravel-homestead-on-windows-10/phpstorm/interpreter-vagrant-via-deployment.PNG" alt="Run vagrant via deployment" /></a></li>
<li>
<p>Hit &quot;OK&quot; in all open windows to save the changes we just made and run the &quot;test.php&quot; file.
This should generate the following output:</p>
<pre><code>sftp://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222/usr/bin/php /vagrant_data/test.php
1

Process finished with exit code 0</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>sftp://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2222/usr/bin/php /vagrant_data/test.php</code> verifies, that we are actually using the php interpreter within the vagrant box:</p>
<ul>
<li>via <code>sftp://</code></li>
<li>with username <code>vagrant</code></li>
<li>on <code>127.0.0.1:2222</code></li>
<li>using <code>/usr/bin/php</code></li>
<li>to execute <code>/vagrant_data/test.php</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whoop whoop, that's it :) Oh and because homestead comes pre-installed with Xdebug, we could even set a breakpoint and halt the execution <em>within the virtual
machine</em> - now is that something or what? Before we go on let's shut down the VM by running <code>vagrant halt</code> on the host machine. This will simply shut down
the VM but all changes we made to it stay in place. If you want to make a completely fresh start, use <code>vagrant destroy</code> and confirm that you really want
to &quot;destroy&quot; the VM.</p>
